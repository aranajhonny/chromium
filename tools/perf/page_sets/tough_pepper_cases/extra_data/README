--- How to build the touch_drawing_plugin.pexe ---

1. Download the Native Client SDK at
   https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/download
2. Create a directory input_event_private at
   (NACL_SDK_ROOT)/examples/api/input_event_private
3. Copy Makefile and touch_drawing_plugin.cc over to input_event_private/
4. Run "TOOLCHAIN=pnacl make"  in input_event_private/



--- How the plugin telemetry test work ---

tough_scheduling_cases.simple_pepper_plugin.html is the test page which
has an <embed> element that loads the platform independent executable
touch_drawing_plugin.pexe. The plugin paints a square for each touch move
event and tracks the input latency of the touch event through private API
InputEventPrivate.
