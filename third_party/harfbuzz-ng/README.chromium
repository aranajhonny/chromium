Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc from the tarball's src folder
over to src, then checking for removed or added files and updating
our build recipes in BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp accordingly.

A Windows build fix and a patch to disablw cswh were cherry-picked from
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/commit/385cf37cf084198e3aedb4354a7b025938a9f11b
