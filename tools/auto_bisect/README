This directory contains modules related to tools for bisecting regressions.

There are several different tools for bisecting regressions; the main use
of these tools is to find revisions where a performance regression occurred.
These tools are generally run by trybots but can also be run locally.

Overview of bisect-related files in src/tools:
  run-bisect-perf-regression.py
     -- the script used to kick off a normal performance regression bisect job.
  run-bisect-perf-regression.cfg
     -- this file contains parameters for a bisect job, and is read by other
        modules including run-bisect-perf-regresion.py.
  run-bisect-manual-test.py
     -- a script which is used to manually bisect regressions; this also
        depends on bisect-perf-gression.py.
  bisect-perf-regression.py
     -- the main module which the others depend on.
  bisect-manual-test.py
     -- a helper module used when manually bisect regressions.
