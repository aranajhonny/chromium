Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the binutils tools
(including gold linker).

They were built from binutils-2.24 using the "build-all.sh" script on a Ubuntu
Precise.

The script creates chroots for 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu Lucid and then builds
binutils inside the roots.

Local patches:
 * ehframe.patch for http://crbug.com/161942

 * (build-all.sh|build-one.sh|upload.sh) scripts for building the binutils
   binaries and uploading them to Google storage.
