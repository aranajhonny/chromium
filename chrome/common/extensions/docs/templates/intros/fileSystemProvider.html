<p>You must declare the "fileSystemProvider" permission
in the <a href="manifest">extension manifest</a>
to use the File System Provider API.
For example:</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"permissions": [
    "fileSystemProvider"
  ]</b>,
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
File System Provider API allows extensions to support virtual file systems,
which are available in the file manager on Chrome OS.
Use cases include decompressing archives and accessing files in a cloud
service other than Drive.
</p>

<h2 id="archives">File handlers</h2>
<p>
Provided file systems can either provide file system contents from an external
source (such as a remote server), or using a local file (such as an archive) as
its input.
</p>
<p>
In the second case, the providing extension should have a
<a href="manifest/file_handlers">file_handlers</a> manifest entry in order
to be launched when the file is selected in the file manager.
When the extension is executed with a file to be handled, it has to mount a
file system and start serving contents from the provided file.
</p>

<h2 id="archives">Life cycle</h2>
<p>
Provided file systems once mounted are remembered by Chrome and remounted
automatically after reboot or restart. Hence, once a file system is
<a href="method-mount">mounted</a> by a providing extension, it will stay until
either the extension is unloaded, or the extension calls the
<a href="#method-unmount"> unmount</a> method.
</p>
<p>
In case of acting as a file handler, the handled file may need to be stored
to access it after either a reboot, or suspending and resuming an event page
of the providing extension. In such case
<a href="fileSystem#method-retainEntry">chrome.fileSystem.retainEntry</a> and
<a href="fileSystem#method-restoreEntry">chrome.fileSystem.restoreEntry</a>
should be used.
